> ### Hypixel Portfolio

While I was still working with Hypixel as a Level Designer, I was applying to join their new team to create a stand alone game. I collected a bunch of projects I had worked on and put them in a portfolio, as well as knowledge of different coding languages. Only about half of the projects I actually worked on are on my portfolio since I'm still under NDA and cannot have images of those released.
